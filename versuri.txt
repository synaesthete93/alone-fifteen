Remember how it used to be
The world had made us refugees
I held your hand

Two kindred souls, so paranoid 
You walked with me into the void / I walked with you into the void
Deep down inside
You walked away
Leaving me prey
To shadows and dismay
You left me to walk through hell
Alone

And when this nightmare comes to end
Will you still see me as a friend
Will you pretend
That all is well
Will you forget
How you abandoned me that day / How you abandoned me in hell
And left me to walk through hell
Alone
